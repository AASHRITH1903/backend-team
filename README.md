# backend-team

- develop admin / club-head login
- design proper collection schema
- handle image uploads
- get access and sunbscription to google forms
- basic CRUD facility for all the admins in terms of profile as well as events
- currently the set of events is stuck with the present club-head once their tenure is over the events conducted by them won't remain in the database.
